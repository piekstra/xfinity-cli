# Contributing to xfinity-cli

Thanks for helping out! This is a small, focused CLI over Xfinity's
undocumented self-care services. Xfinity publishes no official API, so
endpoint behavior can change without notice.

## Before you start

- Open or comment on an issue describing the change.
- Branch from `main` (`feat/…`, `fix/…`, `docs/…`); don't push to `main` directly.
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

## Local checks (must pass)

```sh
cargo fmt --all
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test
cargo build --release
```

## Ground rules

- **No secrets, sessions, account numbers, addresses, or other personal data**
  in code, tests, fixtures, commits, or issue attachments.
- Sessions belong in the OS keychain only. Never print, log, or serialize a
  credential; wrap sensitive strings in `secrets::Secret`.
- Keep parsing **best-effort**: a missing field should degrade gracefully
  (fall back to `--json`), not panic.
- Keep it personal-scale. No features whose purpose is bulk collection or
  hammering Xfinity's endpoints.

## The CLI family & cli-common

This repo is part of a family of CLIs (fpl, xfin, lrfl, tojfl, …) that share a
surface spec and library crates: [piekstra/cli-common](https://github.com/piekstra/cli-common)
(**piekstra-cli/1**). Before adding anything reusable — output rendering,
secret handling, config storage, self-update, DTO shapes — check whether it
belongs in cli-common's `pk-cli-*` crates instead. Contributions of shared,
reusable pieces to cli-common are encouraged and preferred over per-repo
copies; consume them here as tag-pinned git dependencies.

Surface changes (new standard commands/flags, DTO fields, exit codes) start as
a spec change in cli-common's `DESIGN.md`.

On macOS, run cli-common's `scripts/setup-dev-signing.sh` once and build with
`make dev` so keychain "Always Allow" grants survive rebuilds.
